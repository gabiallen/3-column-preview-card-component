## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile and Desktop media types

### What I learned

```html
<main class="container">
  A container class can hold all content so that I can edit the margin and
  padding
</main>
```

```css
/* Mobile Only Styles */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .flex {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) - This taught me how to use pseudo-elements to make an element change on hover.
- [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This was useful to refer to when deciding what HTML tag I should use for each element.
